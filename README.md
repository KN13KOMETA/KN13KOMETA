# Be Quiet, Wanderer / Clint Is Here

I am JS/TS developer. I mostly write discord bots, but it's fun to do something else. I listen hardCORE/speedCORE/splitterCORE/extraTONE and other *CORE, my [playlist](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLwuTirF-HU3HcOW5vfMFBUF5Kz4tAbHDy). <a target="_blank" href="https://wakatime.com/@ClintFlames"><img src="https://wakatime.com/badge/user/3e783793-7e39-46f3-a49b-560625ddc898.svg?style=flat"></a>

# More about me
I started learning js in 2019, and almost immediately became interested in bot development. In the same year my first serious project was written - a discord bot (more about this [here](https://github.com/ClintFlames/asoul-r)). Later, I wrote applications on express, made low-quality modules and games on unity/godot and pure js. In a 2022 (i think) i started learning Haxe. Not so long ago I wrote a userscript that showed allies on the radar in the game diep.io. And many many other things.<br>
P.S. Serious doesn't mean that it was well written in terms of code, it means that it was completed since now 99% of my projects are frozen/abandoned/lack of motivation.<br>
P.S.S. You can’t find much of what I’m talking about on github, since these projects are abandoned / unfinished or were just small scripts.
